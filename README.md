# ToyCompiler
ToyCompiler made as a part of course .

This was the first project done by me after I learnt programming and Data structures excuse the code smell. 

Fun Facts - 
1. It has data structures implemented from scatch like lists, stack , tree and hash table.
2. Created my own format to represent configuration .(Reason - Didn't know JSON existed :(. )

Have fun looking at my code at my expense :(
